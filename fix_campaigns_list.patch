## Fix for Campaigns List Screen

The campaigns list screen has been corrupted by global replacements. Here's a summary of what needs to be fixed:

### Critical Issues to Fix:

1. **Import statements**: Fix broken imports
2. **Variable references**: Fix widget.campaign references  
3. **Provider access**: Fix TouringTaskMovementService access
4. **Campaign card**: Complete the active task indicator

### Quick Fix Approach:

Since the file is severely corrupted, the best approach is to:

1. Revert the campaigns_list_screen.dart from git
2. Apply only the necessary changes for active task indicators
3. Use a simpler approach that doesn't require major refactoring

### Alternative Simple Solution:

Instead of complex campaign card modifications, add a simple indicator:

```dart
// In the CampaignCard build method, add this before the existing content:
Consumer<TouringTaskMovementService>(
  builder: (context, service, child) {
    if (service.currentTask?.campaignId == campaign.id && service.isSessionActive) {
      return Container(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(8),
        color: Colors.orange.withOpacity(0.1),
        child: Row(
          children: [
            Icon(Icons.timer, size: 16, color: Colors.orange),
            SizedBox(width: 8),
            Text('Active Task Running', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.orange, fontSize: 12)),
          ],
        ),
      );
    }
    return SizedBox.shrink();
  },
)
```

This provides the essential functionality without complex modifications.
