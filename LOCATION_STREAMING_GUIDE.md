# Location Streaming Approach (No Background Service)

## ‚úÖ What Changed

Replaced the problematic background service with **Geolocator position streaming** that should work better when the phone is locked.

## üìç New Tracking Method

### Position Streaming:
- **Continuous tracking** using `Geolocator.getPositionStream()`
- **Movement-based updates**: Every 10 meters of movement
- **High accuracy** location tracking
- **Works in background** without complex notification handling

### Fallback System:
- If streaming fails, falls back to timer-based tracking (every 15 seconds)
- Robust error handling and logging

## üöÄ Expected Behavior

### When App is Active:
- **Continuous location updates** based on movement
- **High accuracy** tracking with detailed logging
- **Real-time geofence monitoring**

### When Phone is Locked/App Backgrounded:
- **Position stream continues** (Geolocator handles background tracking)
- **Updates on movement** (every 10 meters)
- **No notification required** (uses native Android location services)

## üì± Testing Instructions

1. **Install new APK**:
   ```
   build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
   ```

2. **Login as agent** and grant location permissions

3. **Test foreground tracking**:
   - Move around and check for location updates in logs
   - Database should receive location data

4. **Test background tracking**:
   - Lock phone or minimize app
   - Move around (walk/drive at least 10 meters)
   - Check database for continued location updates
   - No crash should occur

## üîç Debugging

Check logs for these messages:
- `"Location streaming started (works in background)"`
- `"Stream location: lat, lng (accuracy: Xm)"`
- If fallback: `"Fallback to timer-based location tracking"`

## üéØ Advantages of This Approach

1. **No Background Service**: Eliminates notification crashes
2. **Native Android Integration**: Uses Android's built-in location services
3. **Battery Efficient**: Updates only on movement, not fixed intervals
4. **More Reliable**: Less likely to be killed by system
5. **Simpler Architecture**: Fewer moving parts to break

## ‚ö† Important Notes

- **Movement Required**: Updates when user moves ‚â•10 meters
- **Permission Dependent**: Requires "Allow all the time" for background tracking
- **Battery Optimization**: Users may need to disable battery optimization for the app

This approach should resolve the crash issues while still providing background location tracking!
