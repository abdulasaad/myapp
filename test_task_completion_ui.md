# Task Completion UI Test

## Test: Task Completion Status Display

**What was implemented:**
- Updated `agent_task_list_screen.dart` to show "Task Completed" status instead of action buttons when tasks are completed
- Added green completion badge with check icon for completed tasks
- Maintains existing functionality for pending and in-progress tasks

**Test Steps:**

1. **Login as Agent**
   - Use agent credentials to access the app
   - Navigate to campaign tasks

2. **View Pending Tasks**
   - Should see "Awaiting Manager Approval" (orange badge)
   - No action buttons available

3. **View In-Progress Tasks**
   - Should see "Start Guided Task" button
   - Should see "Quick Upload" and "Mark Done" buttons
   - Can interact with task execution

4. **View Completed Tasks**
   - âœ… Should see "Task Completed" (green badge with check icon)
   - No action buttons (Start Task, Quick Upload, Mark Done)
   - Green background styling indicates completion

**Expected Behavior:**

| Task Status | Display | Actions Available |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `pending` | ðŸŸ  "Awaiting Manager Approval" | None |
| `assigned` / `in_progress` | ðŸ”µ "Start Guided Task", "Quick Upload", "Mark Done" | All task actions |
| `completed` | ðŸŸ¢ "Task Completed" âœ… | None |

**Code Changes:**

```dart
// Added this section to agent_task_list_screen.dart
] else if (isCompleted) ...[
  Container(
    width: double.infinity,
    padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 16),
    decoration: BoxDecoration(
      color: Colors.green[50],
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
      border: Border.all(color: Colors.green[200]!),
    ),
    child: Row(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Icon(Icons.check_circle, color: Colors.green[600], size: 20),
        const SizedBox(width: 8),
        Text(
          AppLocalizations.of(context)!.taskCompleted,
          style: TextStyle(
            color: Colors.green[600],
            fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
          ),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ),
] else if (!isCompleted) ...[
  // Existing action buttons for non-completed tasks
```

**Visual Result:**
- Completed tasks now show a clear, visually distinct "Task Completed" status
- Consistent with the existing UI patterns (similar to pending tasks)
- Uses green color scheme to indicate successful completion
- Check circle icon reinforces completion status

**Related Files:**
- `lib/screens/agent/agent_task_list_screen.dart` - Main implementation
- `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` - Contains "taskCompleted" localization string
- `lib/l10n/app_ar.arb` - Contains Arabic translation

The implementation successfully addresses the user's request to show "Complete" status instead of action buttons for completed tasks.
